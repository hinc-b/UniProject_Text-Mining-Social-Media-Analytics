# UniProject_Text-Mining-Social-Media-Analytics


## Project scope:
Project focused on Social Media Analytics and Text Mining topics in the context of 2020 US Presidential Elections.
** The aim of the project ** is to investigate the posts of Tweeter users that were created in the pre-election period for the presidency of the United States of America in 2020.

** The subject of the study ** are posts about the candidates for the US presidency - J. Biden and D. Trump. Thus, these are not candidates' posts, but posts about candidates.

1. How did the residents of the USA and other countries express themselves about the candidates?
2. Which languages were used most often?
3. What form of application (web, mobile, etc.) was most often used to post entries?
4. What was the activity of Twitter users writing about the candidates? What could this activity be related to?
5. What were the most common words?
6. Which posts about a given candidate were more opinions and which were facts?
7. As well as - ** On the basis of the collected data, it can be stated that the election results were falsified, or was the counting of votes correct? **
